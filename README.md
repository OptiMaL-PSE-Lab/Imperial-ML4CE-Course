## ðŸ“‚ Coursework Task: Optimisation of a Bioprocess with Batch Bayesian Optimisation

This coursework involves the optimisation of a simulated bioprocess at process scale utilising CHO cells to produce a desired protein. Experimentally, this would involve a resource-intensive screening campaign involving the growth and feeding of cells under precise conditions (temperature, pH, feed amount, cell type, etc.) to maximize the production of a desired product. This coursework offers a simulated method of mapping bioprocess input parameters to a final predicted titre concentration: a measure of cell productivity. Your goal is to create a batch Bayesian Optimisation algorithm to obtain input parameters which maximizes titre concentration of the simulated bioprocess. 

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OptiMaL-PSE-Lab/Imperial-ML4CE-Course
   cd BatchBayesianOptimization
   ```

    conda (recommended):
    ```bash
    conda create --name myenv python=3.10 
    conda activate myenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    pip:
    ```bash
