# Williams-Otto Benchmark Coursework

This subfolder contains the coursework materials for the **Williams-Otto (WO) constrained optimization problem**, used to test data-driven optimization algorithms.  
The main repo already introduces the problem‚Äîthis README focuses on the provided code structure and usage, and the .docx gives details on the problem.
